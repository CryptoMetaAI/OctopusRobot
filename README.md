# What
Octopus Robot dAPP is a totally decentralized application which can help you connect different blockchain or web2. 


# How
In this dAPP, you can create scripts which are composited by some subScripts.

Every subScript could be a web2 request with web service or a web3 request with node of blockchain.

For some examples, you can:

- read one coin's price from CEX, then write is to the contract deployed on ethereum.

- monitor the events or transcations from the blockchain, then send a transaction to invoke the contract to execute expected action.

- read data from web2, then check the value of contract on blockchain, if satisfy the condition, send a transaction.

- set a timer, and mint NFTs automatically when the time comes

- compare the prices of coins on CEX or DEX, then arbitrage.

- ...

# Why
In Web3, almost all of the developers need to write script to implement some interactions between Web2 & Web3, which is a private and duplicated job I think.
What they write in the script, only can be run by themselves, and the main logic is similiar too. And I think we could simplify these jobs and make the script run by everyone who is even not a developer.
